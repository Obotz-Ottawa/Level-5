if(on_time == 1) → check if new data is sent
if(off_time>700) → means weather data the is recived, logic becomes 1

Keycode!=(long)1<<(32 - position); → Formula left shift 1 to respevite bit position. → it resrictes the number from going more than 32
Serial.println(keycode, HEX); → Display the value in HexaDeciaml Form.
