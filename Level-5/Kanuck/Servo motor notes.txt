Servo Motor: 

Commands we will be using in Aruduino:

int var = 0; →used as a comperator
→int angle = 0; → used for the angle

PWM - Pulse Width Modulation

Frequency = 1/T =, Where T is time mesured in seconds

TCCR0 = 0x03; → to scale 16 to 50 HZ for the servo motor
for servo motor to work we need 50 HZ

void Servo() - function used for using servo motor

int tem = (5 + (angle/10))

if(var == tem) → Comparator
